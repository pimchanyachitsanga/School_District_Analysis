# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview 
Maria has given us two data sets that contain the information of the students and the schools in the district. We initially clean up the data received by identifying prefix and suffix that are not a part of first and last time in the students data set. After successfully cleaned up the data, we then able to join two data sets to further analyze the factors that drive the student's test scores performance among the schools in the district. The following factors were used to determine the school with high test passing rates: school type, school size, and budget.

## Challenge Overview
Upon the completion of the analysis, the school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Maria has asked us to further analyze the data by replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. She has also asked us to provide a written report
describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
